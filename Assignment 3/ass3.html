  <p>I am currently in my second year of my B.Techâ€™s Degree. I am 19 years old and studying in<br> CHARUSAT University. I can speak three languages fluently which includes Gujrati, Hindi<br> and English.As a student in computer engineering I'm having my skils in C++,CSS, HTML,<br>Os. I hope to be accepted to various programs that focus on developing my communicating<br> skills that will hopefully be useful as I aim to be an efficient developer. One of my passions<br> are travelling all over the world especially Barcelona. Other things I am interested into are :<br><br> &#8226; Dance<br>&#8226; Cricket<br>&#8226;  Painting<br>&#8226; Reading<br><br>  Mostly I spend my free time reading classic novels.</p>
